# Mule Lint
Static analyzer for Mule configuration files

## Goal
The goal of Mule Lint is to help enforce proper and consitent Mule configurations based on MuleSoft's best practices. Mule Lint should be incorporated into the Mule Application build process.

For example:
* Configurable parameters should be placed into property file(s)
* All configurations should use hostnames vs IP Addresses
* Passwords should be encrypted

## TODO
1. Define Mule Lint's configuration schema
2. Create Mule Lint's engine
3. Capture MuleSoft's best practices in Mule Lint's configuration file
4. Incorporate Mule Lint into the MuleSoft Development Lifecycle Demo
